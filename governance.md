## The Project

The Skyhook Data Management Project (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal 
of The Project is to develop open source software and related technology for 
the computational I/O stack. The Project endeavors to extend the 
broader software ecosystem of storage systems, networking, and data science.  
The Software developed by The Project is
released under a variety of open source software licenses that are both approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) 
and recognized as free by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), is developed openly, and 
hosted in public GitHub repositories under the skyhookdm GitHub organization.
Examples of Project Software include the tools and configurations related to the
deployment of computational infrastructure. The Services run by The Project
consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted under the pangeo.io
or pangeo-data.org domains. Examples of Project Services include the Pangeo
website (https://skyhookdm.github.io) and ...

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed to code, code
reviews, documentation, design, and infrastructure, or to mailing lists, chats,
community help and community building, education and outreach, or other work in
relation to one or more Project repositories. Anyone can be a Contributor.
Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors
participate in The Project by submitting, reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull
Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on
GitHub, Gitter chat rooms and mailing lists. The foundation of Project
participation is openness and transparency.

Here is a list of the current Contributors to the main Pangeo repository:

There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories
of the SkyhookDM Project.

The collection of all Contributors to The Project and stakeholders in The
Project, including Users and Funders, is called The Community.  Contributors
work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project Community and we
strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible.


## Governance

### The Steering Council

The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project Contributors
nominated as expalined below. The Steering Council should be composed of
a diverse array of backgrounds, viewpoints and talents. The overall role of the
Council is to ensure, through taking input from the Community, the long-term
well-being of The Project, both technically and as a community. As The Project
draws its strength from representing the Community, it strives to avoid
fragmentation of the Community into separate projects, if possible.

During the everyday Project activities, Council Members participate in all
discussions, code review and other Project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members do
not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the Council.
However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of their
contributions and their expert knowledge of The Project Software and Services
that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms
of Project direction, to potentially less experienced Contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may:

* Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of The Project.
* Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
  individuals.
* Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
  requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process and
  merging pull requests.
* Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those
  Services for the benefit of The Project and Community.
* Make decisions when regular Community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on
  an issue in a reasonable time frame.

Outcomes and decisions should be clearly communicated to the Community. This can
take three different forms:

* New challenges for SkyhookDM will be detailed as a GitHub issue for the Community
  to discuss.
* Resolved technical deadlocks will result in an explanation on the relevant
  issue and/or closure of the relevant pull request.
* Other decisions will be detailed as a narrative blog post.

#### Council Membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a
Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least six months. Potential Council
Members are nominated by Community Contributors and voted upon by the existing
Council, after asking if the potential Member is interested and willing to serve
in that capacity. 

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
The Project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which Council Membership will be evaluated.

There are two mechanisms by which a Council Member may exit the Steering
Council:

1. Council Members may resign their posting at any time during their tenure on
   the Steering Council. In order to maintain an active, energetic, and healthy
   council, Council Members will self-facilitate membership check-ins every 6
   months to confirm that each member intends on continue their service on the
   Council.
2. If a Council Member becomes inactive in The Project for a period of one year,
   they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, an
   inactive Member will be approached by a Council Member to see if they plan
   on returning to active participation. If not they will be removed immediately
   upon a Council vote. If they plan on returning to active participation soon,
   they will be given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active
   participation within that time period they will be removed by vote of the
   Council without further grace period.

All former Council Members can be considered for Membership again at any time
in the future, like any other Project Contributor. Retired Council Members
will be listed on the Project website, acknowledging the period during which
they were active in the Council.

#### Expectations for Council Members

Steering council members are expected to commit to the following activities:
- Attend a one-hour steering council meeting every quarter.
- Respond in a timely manner to steering-council-related correspondence.
- Act as an ambassador for the project in professional contexts.

#### Conflict of Interest

It is expected that Council Members will be employed at a wide range of
companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is
possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:

* Financial interests, such as investments, employment, or contracting work,
  outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
* Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
  leak into their work with The Project.
* An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project
  resources, but The Project has no gain or suffers a disadvantage.

All Members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council any
conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a
particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue, but must
recuse themselves from voting on the issue.

## Institutional Partners and Funding

The Steering Council is the primary leadership for The Project. No outside
institution, individual or legal entity has the ability to own, control, usurp
or influence The Project other than by participating in The Project as
Contributors and Council Members. However, because institutions are the primary
funding mechanism for The Project, it is important to formally acknowledge
institutional participation in The Project. These are Institutional Partners.

An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who
contributes to The Project as part of their official duties at an Institutional
Partner sustained over at least six months. Likewise, an Institutional Council
Member is any Project Steering Council Member who contributes to The Project as
part of their official duties at an Institutional Partner.

With these definitions, an Institutional Partner is any recognized legal entity
anywhere in the world that employs at least one Institutional Contributor or
Institutional Council Member. Institutional Partners can be for-profit or
non-profit entities.

Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by employing
individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part of their official
duties. To state this another way, the only way for an Institutional Partner to
influence The Project is by actively contributing to the open development of The
Project, on equal terms with any other member of the community of Contributors
and Council Members. Merely using Project Software or Services in an
institutional context does not allow an entity to become an Institutional
Partner. Financial gifts do not enable an entity to become an Institutional
Partner. Once an institution becomes eligible for Institutional Partnership,
the Steering Council must nominate and approve the Partnership.

If an existing Institutional Partner no longer has a contributing employee, they
will be given a one-year grace period for other employees to begin contributing.

An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on The Project
through any legal means, though the Institutional Partner is obliged to inform
the Steering Council of any such decisions. This could involve a non-profit
organization raising money from private foundations and donors or a for-profit
company building proprietary products and services that leverage Project
Software and Services. Funding acquired by Institutional Partners to work on The
Project is called Institutional Funding. However, no funding obtained by an
Institutional Partner can override the decisions of the Steering Council. If a
Partner has funding to do Project work and the Council decides to not pursue
that work as a project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their own. However,
in this situation, that part of the Partner’s work will not be under The Project
umbrella.

## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull request to
The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at
https://github.com/skyhookdm/governance. The pull request is then refined in
response to public comment and review, with the goal being consensus in the
community. The period for open comment will last in proportional to the
complexity of the changes; major changes will be open for comment for no less
than two weeks. After this open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to
the Steering Council that the changes be ratified and the pull request merged
(accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed
without merging (rejecting the proposed changes). The Member should state the
final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance or rejection
and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of the Steering Council
must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be positive to carry out the
proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer).

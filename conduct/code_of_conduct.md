# SkyhookDM Code of Conduct

SkyhookDM values the safety and security of all of our members and, 
because of that, we will not tolerate any form of harassment or 
discrimination. To this end in this page we:

* Provide a statement of intent and code of conduct for members of our community;
* Outline and define forms of harassment and discrimination;
* Outline the consequences for those who engage in harassing or discriminatory behavior;
* Provide a system for reporting any harassing or discriminatory behavior
* Commit to a periodic review of the code of conduct


## Statement of Intent of the SkyhookDM Community

SkyhookDM is an engaged and respectful community made up of people
from all over the world. Your involvement helps us to further our
mission and to create an open platform that serves a broad range of
communities, from research and education, to journalism, industry and
beyond.

SkyhookDM is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. 
We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. 
This applies equally to founders, developers, mentors and new community members, 
in all spaces managed by SkyhookDM. This includes the mailing lists,
our GitHub organizations, our chat rooms, in-person events, and any other
forums created by the project team. In addition, violations of this code
outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.


## Code of Conduct

   
* **1. Be friendly, patient, and welcoming**.    
   We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
   people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
   to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
   immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
   orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
   status, technological or professional choices, academic
   discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.

* **2. Be considerate and respectful**.    
   Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
   making decisions.    
   Remember that we're a world-wide community, and that you may be
   communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
   background. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners.
   Do not insult or put down other community members. A community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.    
   
   
* **3. Consider Impact vs. Intent**.    
   Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time and SkyhookDM is no exception. 
   People perceive their own behaviors very differently than others perceive them. 
   What motivates one person may cause stress for another. 
   A few steps worth remembering include the following:

   * Other people do not see things the same way you do, 
   do not feel the same as you, or interpret the world the way you do. 
   Consider different people’s perspectives on things like change, 
   drive, structure, process, big picture, and small details.
   * Ask for feedback and listen to them. 
   * Blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn from mistakes to find better solutions. 

* **4. Moderate your expectations**.    
   Please respect that community members choose
   how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question about your
   expectations is preferable to demands for another person's time.

* **5. A simple apology can go a long way**.    
   It can often de-escalate a situation,
   and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn’t
   automatically imply an admission of guilt.


Rather than considering this code an exhaustive list
of things that you *can’t* do, take it in the spirit it is intended - a guide to
make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. 
By embracing the following principles, guidelines and actions to follow or
avoid, you will help us make SkyhookDM a welcoming and productive community. Feel
free to contact the Code of Conduct Committee at
[skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu](mailto:skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu) with any questions.

## Forms of harrassment

We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. 
Forms of harrassment include, but is not limited to:

   * Violent threats or violent language directed against another person
   * Discriminatory jokes and language
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material
   * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
     information ("doxing")
   * Personal insults, especially those related to gender, 
   gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, 
   physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, 
   religion, socioeconomic status, caste or creed
   * Unwelcome sexual attention, stalking;
   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
     then stop
          

## Consequences for Harassment and Discrimination

If a member of the community at large engages in behavior which is harassing 
or discriminatory in any way, once the incident is reported, 
the [Code of Conduct Committee](mailto:skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu) may take any action they deem 
appropriate listed in the [*Enforcement Manual*](enforcement.md). 
These actions include, but are not limited to, issuing a warning, 
requiring an apology, or a permanent or temporary ban from some 
or all SkyhookDM spaces (mailing lists, gitter.im, etc.). 


## How to Report Harassment and Discrimination

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in
a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community
for everyone and we take them seriously.

You can file a report by emailing
[skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu](mailto:skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu) or by filing out 
[this form](https://forms.gle/qaszuCWz2pYXjvad9). The online form gives you the option to 
keep your report anonymous or request that we follow up with you directly. While we cannot
follow up on an anonymous report, we will take appropriate action.

For more details or information on reporting in-person at an event, please see our Reporting
Guidelines.   
For information on enforcement, please view the [*Enforcement
Manual*](enforcement.md).


## Periodic Review

SkyhookDM strives to create a positive and inclusive environment. 
As such, the SkyhookDM Steering Council commits to an annual review 
of the Code of Conduct to ensure that it continues to align with 
this goal and address the needs of our community.
SkyhookDM welcomes feedback from its members. 
Feedback can be submitted to: skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu](mailto:skyhookdm-conduct-group@ucsc.edu) and to this github repository.
